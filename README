Solutions to the Project Euler problems in various programming languages

c - C11/POSIX implementations for an arbitrary input parameter
	make build to compile all binaries in the src subdir
	make all to compile binaries and also run tests

	Limitations: does not check for numeric overflows, consequently a number of the solutions will produce incorrect answers for very large input parameters
