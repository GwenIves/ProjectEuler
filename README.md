# Project Euler Solutions

Solutions to the Project Euler problems in various programming languages


Unless noted otherwise in the language sections, every solution should be:
   * General - supports calculations for an arbitrary input parameter
   * Fast - finishes at worst in hundreds of milliseconds for the reference input using contemporary hardware
   * Self-contained - no 3rd party or non-standard library usage
   * Clear - employs good software engineering practices and language idioms


## Currently implemented problems:
   * C - 55 problems


## Build instructions and language notes

### C11/POSIX

An example of a barebones imperative language solution.

Build by running make from the top of the c/ directory tree

	make build      // default, compiles all binaries in the src subdir
	make all        // compiles binaries and also runs tests
	make tests      // runs all tests
	make clean      // deletes compilation related generated files
	make distclean  // deletes all generated files
	make tags       // creates a single ctags database with symbol lookups

#### Limitations
Does not check for numeric overflows, consequently a number of the solutions will produce incorrect answers for very large input parameters
